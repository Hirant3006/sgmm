When executing tasks related to user interface design, you must strictly follow these core design principles and best practices:

1. **Consistency:**
   - Maintain consistent use of colors, fonts, icons, spacing, and interactions throughout the UI.
   - Align elements uniformly to ensure visual harmony.

2. **Clarity:**
   - Use simple, clear, and precise language for labels, buttons, and messages.
   - Ensure that functionality is self-explanatory and intuitive.

3. **Accessibility:**
   - Adhere to WCAG guidelines, ensuring UI elements have sufficient contrast, appropriate font sizes, and clear navigation structures.
   - Include ARIA labels and roles to enhance usability for all users.

4. **Feedback:**
   - Provide immediate and clear feedback to users through visual or interactive cues after actions are performed.
   - Clearly indicate errors, loading states, and success conditions.

5. **User Control and Freedom:**
   - Allow users to undo actions, go back, or exit processes easily.
   - Avoid trapping users in a state without clear exits.

6. **Simplicity and Minimalism:**
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity; prioritize content and features according to user needs.
   - Ensure the UI design is clean, minimal, and focused.

7. **Efficiency:**
   - Optimize workflows and minimize user effort.
   - Group related elements logically and facilitate shortcuts or quick actions.

8. **Responsiveness:**
   - Design UIs that adapt gracefully across different screen sizes and devices.
   - Ensure touch targets and interactive elements remain accessible and effective.

When executing UI tasks, always confirm that your design decisions align with these principles, explicitly state the principle you are following, and briefly explain how your decision supports a better user experience.
